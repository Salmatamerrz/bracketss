# bracketss

This code helps you track whether the parantheses are equal or not 
lets say (] those are not the same so the code will return that they are not equal
the opening and the closing are not the same so it will return False
I have implemented the code using a stack where i defined the openings and the closing and made sure that it has to be the same as known as pairs
